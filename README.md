# Peace of Mind

## Day 1: Wireframe/Mockup & Initial Setup

### Overview

Day 1 focused on laying the foundation for the "Peace of Mind" project. This involved designing the wireframe/mockup, finalizing the overall design, selecting fonts and themes, setting up content for the website, and preparing the project for development. Additionally, the initial setup for external APIs and dependencies was completed.

#### What I Did on Day 1:

1. **Wireframe/Mockup**

- Took time to design a clean and user-friendly wireframe/mockup.
- The wireframe helped visualize the layout, including key sections like the Journal Dashboard, Mood Tracker, and Resources page.

2. **Finalize Design**

- Chose a design style that aligns with the peaceful and calming nature of the project. This includes soft colors, easy navigation, and an intuitive layout.
- I focused on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring users feel comfortable navigating through the app.

3. **Theme and Fonts**

- Spent time experimenting with various color themes and fonts to find a calming aesthetic. The final choice features a soft, neutral color palette with contrasting elements for clarity.
- Chose a combination of serene fonts for headings and clean, readable fonts for body text, ensuring a cohesive visual experience.

4. **Content**

- Developed the core content for the website, including call-to-action messages, slogans, and other key text.
- The messaging focuses on promoting mental well-being and self-care, with slogans like "Start Your Journey to Peace" and "Find Calm in the Chaos."

5. **Setup Project**

- Created the initial project structure and set up the development environment.
- Installed necessary dependencies to start building out the app.

6. **Install Dependencies**

- Installed key dependencies including Tailwind CSS for styling and DaisyUI for easy theme and component management.
- Set up ZenQuotes API for inspirational quotes and API Ninja Quotes for additional quote sources.

7. **Config Files (Font and DaisyUI)**

- Updated \_app.js to apply fonts help with site's visual appearance.
- Updated `tailwind.config.js` to integrate custom color themes and enable switching (light and dark modes) using DaisyUI.

8. **Setup .env**

- Set up environment variables in .env for storing sensitive data such as API keys and API url.

9. **Create Todos**

- Created a list of todos for the upcoming days to track development progress and ensure a systematic approach to the project.

### Next Steps

For Day 2, I plan to:

- Begin developing the core components for the
  project.
- Test components using Storybook.
